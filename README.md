# Energy Production in South Australia (2015)

Some analysis on windfarms with related price, wind energy and combustion energy data back in 2015.

The interesting figure is [this](figures/windfarm_pca.pdf) which shows that the correlation of energy production between the windfarms is highly correlated with their location.

Note: my R is bad, I know.
